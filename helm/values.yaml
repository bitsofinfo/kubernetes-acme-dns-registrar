# CONDUITS DEFINITIONS: none by default, you must define

conduits:

  # Each set of conduits is scoped within a "context" which is simply
  # a sub-scope within a "environment". It is just an arbitrary name
  # that you can set to whatever you'd like
  # @see: https://github.com/bitsofinfo/appdeploy#convention
  # It will be included on generated k8s names
  contexts:

    # Context "name"
    # It will be included on generated k8s names

      # ---------------------
      # SERVICES
      # Here we define one or more named "services"
      # Each "service" has a "name" and a set of k8s selectors
      # which define what pods the service will target
      #-----------------------

      #services:

        # service "name"
        # It will be included on generated k8s names
        #
        #service-a:

          # If the port of the app the service is for is other than 80
          # which is configured in the defaults "service" section below
          #
          # port: [otherPort]
          # targetPort: [otherPort]

          # If the application the service is for exposes TLS or not
          # optional: default true
          #
          #tls: false

          # The service's selectors, can be any valid k8s label selectors
          # Note: the context selector is ALWAYS applied as such
          # so you don't need to add it manually
          # {service.selectors.contextLabelName}: {{$currentContext}}
          #
          #selector:

            #app-version: "1.0.0"


      # ---------------------
      # INGRESSs
      # Here we define one or more named "Ingress"
      # Each "ingress" has a "name" and a set of one
      # or more "mappings" which configure host/paths
      # that will configured on the generated Ingress'
      # as well as the 'serviceBindings' for the Ingress
      # that point back to the named "services" defined above
      #-----------------------
      #
      #ingress:

        # ingress "name"
        # It will be included on generated k8s names
        #
        #live:

          # Each ingress can have 1-N "mappings"
          #
          #mappings:

            # REQUIRED: arbitrary name
            # It will be included on generated k8s names
            #- name: root

            # Optional: One ore more annotations to apply to each Ingress generated
            #
            #  annotations:
            #    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: Path

            # Optional: One or more labels to apply to each Ingress generated
            #
            #  labels:
            #    bitsofinfo-ingress: "yes"

            # REQUIRED:
            # Important!: for each "host" below a separate Ingress
            # object will be generated explicity for it. Why?
            # because if you are using a program that consumes
            # Ingress definitions (i.e like external-dns) that
            # creates DNS entries for ANY "host" in an ingress
            # and the only way to filter is via Ingress labels
            # then having a 1-to-1 between Ingress and Hosts gives
            # you the ability to cleanly label one Ingress/Host for
            # consumption for dns automation, and omit it for another one.
            # If you don't do this, and have many hosts per Ingress
            # then it becomes hard if not impossible to exclude certain
            # 'hosts' as candidates for consumption by a tool like
            # external-dns (at least as of Q2 2019...)
